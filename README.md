# hello-world
this is a test

im a GitHub beginner, but would like to get started sharing my `matlab.m` codes 

The load moves in a straight line from $x=-x_0$ (Start) to $x=x_0$ (End). The travel path is decomposed into $N$ intervals $(i=1,â€¦,N)$, each $\Delta x$ long. The point of response evaluation is indicated in the Figure; this point is located near the middle of the travel path (i.e., x -coordinate of zero), at y -coordinate $y_0$ and depth $z_0$  below the surface.
